# county geo-json

Good day, country-geojson is a little initiative to provide
the geojson data for markup of a specific country, or countries.

It is inspired from Play-Chess of the1Riddle and relies on similar concepts.

<!-- BEGIN countryList -->
<!-- END countryList -->


<!-- BEGIN geoJSON -->
<!-- END geoJSON -->
